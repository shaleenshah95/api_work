    "\n",
    "Save a CSV called `minutes.csv` with the date and the URL to the file. The date should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus:** Download the PDF files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus 2:** Use [PDF OCR X](https://solutions.weblite.ca/pdfocrx/index.php) on one of the PDF files and see if it can be converted into text successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hint:** If you're just looking for links, there are a lot of other links on that page! Can you look at the link to know whether it links or minutes or not? You'll want to use an \"if\" statement.\n",
    "* **Hint:** You could also filter out bad links later on using pandas instead of when scraping\n",
    "* **Hint:** If you get a weird error that you can't really figure out, you can always tell Python to just ignore it using `try` and `except`, like below. Python will try to do the stuff inside of 'try', but if it hits an error it will skip right out.\n",
    "* **Hint:** Remember the codes at http://strftime.org\n",
    "* **Hint:** If you have a date that you've parsed, you can use `.dt.strftime` to turn it into a specially-formatted string. You use the same codes (like %B etc) that you use for converting strings into dates.\n",
